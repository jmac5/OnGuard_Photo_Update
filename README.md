# OnGuard_Photo_Update
This is a generic version of our script we use at WPI, to help the HELUG community with their photo import needs

Our file names are set to the ID number (at WPI, 9-digits), so 123456789.jpg, for example. This allows us to easily query the DB for the right EMPID to attach the photo to. Depending on how your files are named, you may need to search other tables to find things like first/last, or other identifying info you store in OnGuard.

send me an email at jmac(at)wpi(dot)edu if you have any questions or suggestions! 

Have fun!
